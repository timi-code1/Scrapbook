        If youâ€™re waiting for me to message and Iâ€™m not delivering itâ€™s usually one of three reasons ðŸ¦­ -
        Iâ€™m busy with something and canâ€™t text, Iâ€™ve misread something from before and think youâ€™re unhappy
        with me or youâ€™ve left me on opened and iâ€™m struggling to think of ways to keep the conversation
        alive. If you donâ€™t know which it is and youâ€™re not unhappy with me, js drop me a message and Iâ€™ll
        respond when I see it. I feel like this issue doesnâ€™t come up as often anymore but in the case it
        does, you know what to do !

        I know youâ€™re very observant and notice the smallest changes in my energy that I donâ€™t even mean to
        give away. In the case where Iâ€™m not reciprocating energy enough for you there are a couple of things
        that could have caused it - sometimes I am just genuinely tired and have had a long day. In this case
        given enough energy, I will reciprocate it. However, I do know that it is hard to give and not receive
        so you could ignore me bcs this will probably trigger me to reach out to you, forcing me to give more
        energy and effort. If it was a situation where I was pissed at you, I would suggest just giving me a
        bit of space because when iâ€™m left to myself, I will get over it and miss you eventually!

        When youâ€™re angry with me, try not to be rude to me unprovoked. I know this one can be difficult and
        I seem to overlook it but I still think you should try to remain calm and try to be nice where possible.
        When youâ€™re rude to me it rlly stings a lot, even if I donâ€™t always show it. It replays in my mind a
        lot and can make me think very negatively for that period of time. I can usually sleep it off and move
        on, but it would be better if it was avoided altogether.

    I donâ€™t even need you telling me to know that they needed to be
    better. A common theme while weâ€™ve been together is my lack of understanding what you want from me; I
    always need to be guided; I never know what you want despite it seeming so obvious to you.<br><br>
    Because of that Iâ€™m sorry. Youâ€™ve had to endure me not meeting your standards for a long time and even
    when you do speak up there seems to be improvement maybe in the short term but it doesnâ€™t seem to
    really stick. It must be so frustrating to have had to deal with that for such an extended period of
    time and although I do believe I try to give you what you want, itâ€™s no good if I continuously get it
    wrong.<br><br>
    Attention. Something that I give you here and there. But thatâ€™s not what youâ€™re looking for. Attention
    is something that you rely on for security. So itâ€™s not enough for you to get attention from me one day
    and then not get the same the day after. This is something that made me uncertain when you explained it
    at first. This was not your fault though; my own insecurities made me spiral in my head and think of the
    worst instead of focusing on the main issue at hand being my inconsistent attention towards you. With
    school and all the factors within my life, I do believe it may be a challenge to give you consistent
    attention if Iâ€™m being honest with myself - I do forget some small things. However, Iâ€™m not with you
    because itâ€™s easy, but because I love you so much. I want to make you feel good and appreciated and if
    that takes consistent attention, that's what youâ€™re going to get. Iâ€™ve done it before; when I was in
    America, I would send good morning snaps everyday despite being with my cousins. I can make time to show
    you the attention that you need and instead of being doubtful of the future I will show it to you.<br><br>
    My friends. I know this has been an issue since the start of our relationship. When you were in my snapchat
    account; that was the first of many occasions where my friends would be able to come between me and you. I
    care about their opinions. But that should never lead to our business becoming their business. Iâ€™ve enabled
    them to have too much of a say in our relationship because I allow them to be involved in situations between
    us, as well as taking on board what they say and allowing it to get to me. This has caused you to be
    embarrassed and for them to have biased opinions on us together. I didnâ€™t intend for this to be the case, but
    it is as a result of my actions and lack of consideration for you. I know you donâ€™t deserve to have your name
    and image seen badly by them. I am so sorry. I will fix it whether we get back together or not because the
    principle of it is a bigger issue in itself.<br><br>
    I think the underlying issue here is my lack of independence. I donâ€™t have the initiative to make decisions on
    my own; Iâ€™m always seeking validation from someone or asking someone what I should do. Iâ€™ve always denied sheep
    allegations, but upon reflection, if I am being completely honest with myself, I rarely do things solely because
    it is what I want to do. Even when I do things that I want, It will only be after I have talked to someone who
    has agreed with me on it. This is a problem for me in a relationship. You were dating me because of me, not
    because of what my friends or anyone else thinks. Iâ€™ve been independent before, but right now, I am more of a
    reflection of people around me than I am myself. This will take some working on, and I think that even if you
    havenâ€™t seen it fully, there have been some recent improvements to my mentality. But small improvements arenâ€™t
    enough. If I want to be with you and make you feel secure, I know that Iâ€™ve got to do better and fix up. I
    promise Iâ€™ll do better regardless, but I want you to be able to see the improvement and experience the benefits
    it will have in our relationship.<br><br>
    I canâ€™t let you go. Iâ€™m not sure about the psychology of it all but Iâ€™ve got some sort of attachment to you that
    canâ€™t just be severed. My love for you is so strong, and all I want to be is enough for you. I do strive to be the
    best for you. Itâ€™s not always obvious. It may seem like I take you for granted. But I donâ€™t. I love you so much. I
    say it often, a lot more than in the past as I feel my love has grown more and more over time. But I really mean it.
    It may not be obvious to you through my actions seeming to be contradictory at times. But I donâ€™t ever do anything with
    the intention of causing you pain. Sometimes I just lack the consideration to see how it would make you feel. Itâ€™s an
    issue that you brought up to me in January. I did become more considerate of you. I do think Iâ€™m very considerate. But
    that means nothing if I canâ€™t be considerate all the time. Iâ€™m not perfect. But I can do better. And that is what I will
    do given the opportunity.<br><br>
    I love you more than anything. This letter that Iâ€™m making despite you telling me it would be a waste of time is evidence
    of that. I will go above and beyond to prove the extent of my love for you. I love your character. I love you as a person.
    Hearing you talk about your day is a privilege for me because I am so invested in what you have to say to me. Itâ€™s all the
    small things that I love about you the most. Your mannerisms, your voice, your vocabulary, your scent. I love them because
    they are what I notice when I remember all of our memories together. Iâ€™m always reminiscing of our best memories; our many
    days out after school, our failed build-a-bear day, the bbq at mine, when you came to mine for our sleepover. I feel so
    happy thinking about them, but the thought that we may not be able to create any more memories scares me honestly. I get
    why you feel the need to cut me off and break away from me, but I donâ€™t know if I can do that, and hence I need to make this
    letter as a last ditch effort to try and show you that I am willing to go above and beyond to put in effort for us. You said
    that I donâ€™t put in all the effort in the world and I wonâ€™t. I have to try and challenge this and prove you wrong.<br><br>
    I donâ€™t know if I have given you what you were looking for. But I wouldnâ€™t have been able to live with myself knowing I
    didnâ€™t try at all. I know you feel a need to prove your self respect to yourself and others by leaving me alone. Iâ€™ll
    respect whatever you choose to do. But I am sorry that I did not live up to the standards and expectations that you
    had for me. You deserve to be with your person, and if Iâ€™m not fitting the criteria then you have every right to
    leave me. I just wish Iâ€™m given the opportunity to show you what you wanted.<br><br><em>T</em>`
